# heat-templates

In this directory you will find Heat templates and configuration instructions
required to use Barbican for encrypted Cinder volumes, and for storing Magnum
clusters' and Neutron load balancer's SSL certificates. 

The templates have been tested on OpenStack Mitaka (SUSE OpenStack Cloud 7) and
OpenStack `master` (Devstack), which should apply to Newton 1:1. You will find
the templates and everything needed to instantiate them in the mitaka/ and
newton/ subdirectories, respectively.
